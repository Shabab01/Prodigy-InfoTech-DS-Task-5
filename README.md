# Traffic Accident Data Analysis Project

This repository contains scripts for analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The project also includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors to provide insights into traffic safety.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing**: A Python script that preprocesses the traffic accident dataset, including handling missing values, transforming data types, and extracting relevant features such as road conditions, weather, and time of day.
- **Pattern Analysis**: A Python script that analyzes the dataset to identify patterns and trends in traffic accidents, focusing on factors like road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day.
- **Hotspot Visualization**: A Python script that visualizes accident hotspots on a map using geospatial data and highlights areas with a high frequency of accidents.
- **Contributing Factors Analysis**: A Python script that examines the key factors contributing to accidents, such as poor road conditions, adverse weather, or specific times of day.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project consists of traffic accident records, including details on location, time, weather conditions, road conditions, and the number and severity of accidents.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `geopandas`, `folium`).
3. Place your traffic accident dataset in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
5. Run the pattern analysis script to identify trends related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
6. Run the hotspot visualization script to map accident hotspots.
7. Run the contributing factors analysis script to explore factors influencing traffic accidents.

## Requirements
